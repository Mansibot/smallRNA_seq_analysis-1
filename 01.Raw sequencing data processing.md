## Short read assembly

#### Read trimming with `Trimmomatic`
Read correction is useful to reduce sequencing errors from sequencing reads, thus facilitating efficiency and accuracy of the genome assembly. 
```ShellSession
bfc -b 32 -k 25 -t 8 S1529Nr1_R1_trim.fq.gz | gzip -1 > S1529Nr1_R1_trim.corrected.fq.gz
bfc -b 32 -k 25 -t 8 S1529Nr1_R2_trim.fq.gz | gzip -1 > S1529Nr1_R2_trim.corrected.fq.gz
bfc -b 32 -k 25 -t 8 S1529Nr1_unpaired_trim.fq.gz | gzip -1 > S1529Nr1_unpaired_trim.corrected.fq.gz
