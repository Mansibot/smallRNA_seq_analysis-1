## Short read data processing

### Read trimming
Initial adapter trimming was done with `cutadapt`. 
```ShellSession
cutadapt -u 1 -a TGGAATTCTCGGGTGCCAAGG -m 15 RSB15248-1.fastq > RSB15248-1.cutadapt.fastq
```
Remaining adapters and low-quality bases were removed using `Trimmomatic`. 
```ShellSession
java -jar $PATH/trimmomatic-0.39-1/trimmomatic.jar SE -threads 8 \
    -trimlog log-file RSB15248-1.trimmed.fastq RSB15248-1.cutadapt.fastq \
    SLIDINGWINDOW:3:18 LEADING:6 TRAILING:6 MINLEN:15
```
This yielded 18 adapter- and quality-trimmed smallRNA-seq read files.
